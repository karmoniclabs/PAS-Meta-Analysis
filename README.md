Meta-Regression Analysis
This meta-regression analysis evaluates the impact of various demographic variables on a specific outcome by integrating data from multiple studies.
For each demographic variable, the analysis computes the regression coefficients, p-values, and confidence intervals using generalized least squares (GLS) regression.
The results are meticulously documented, including detailed regression outputs saved in Excel and text files.
Additionally, visualizations of the coefficients and their confidence intervals are generated and compiled into a PDF, providing a comprehensive view of how demographic factors influence the outcome across the included studies.
This approach ensures a thorough understanding of the relationships between demographic variables and the outcome of interest.

Process Overview

    Data Preparation:
        The analysis begins by filtering and preparing data from multiple studies, including both outcome and demographic variables.

    Meta-Regression:
        For each demographic variable, the analysis performs generalized least squares (GLS) regression to compute the regression coefficients, p-values, and confidence intervals.

    Results Documentation:
        The regression results are saved in Excel and text files, providing detailed insights into the relationships between demographic factors and the outcome of interest.

    Visualization:
        Coefficients and their confidence intervals are visualized using error bar plots. These plots are compiled into a PDF for easy interpretation.

Files Generated

    Excel Files: Contain regression results for each demographic variable, with each variable represented as a separate sheet.
    Text Files: Provide a summary of the model, including detailed regression outputs and a list of studies included in the analysis.
    PDF Files: Include visualizations of the coefficients and their confidence intervals.

Example

    Excel File: results_{outcome_variable}.xlsx
    Text File: model_summary_{outcome_variable}.txt
    PDF File: plots_{outcome_variable}.pdf
