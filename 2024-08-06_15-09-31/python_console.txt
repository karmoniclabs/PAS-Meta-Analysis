24 variables. 

M: Provides mean and standard deviation values for each group and a p-value.
OR: Includes odds ratio (OR), along with lower and upper confidence intervals, and a p-value.
RR: Includes relative risk (RR), along with lower and upper confidence intervals, and a p-value.
N: Shows the number and total population for each group and a p-value.
MR: Offers median values and ranges for each group and a p-value.
tM: Provides the mean and standard deviation only for the whole population (both groups).
tMR: Includes the median and range only for the whole population (both groups).

 20 Analyses can be done:
there are data from three or more comparison pairs (i.e. articles) for 20 variables.
